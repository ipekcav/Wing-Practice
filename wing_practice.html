<p>Wing is built with responsive typography based on rems. Wing also changes everything to base 10, so 1 rem is 10px. The font for headers, (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6) is Quicksand. For paragraphs, it is Open Sans. Both fonts are free and served via Google Fonts. It will result in beautiful typography, which can always be overridden. This means that typography comes with things such as links, bold, italics, and underline.</p>
